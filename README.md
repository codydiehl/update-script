# update-script
Interactive all-in-one Update script for MacOS

An all in one update script for my macOS

Covering things like homebrew, pip, vim plug, node.js, npm, gem, mac software update, zprezto, etc. 

Would like to extend to other operating systems, linux especially. there is a few minor linux checks on the scripts so far, but nothing special yet. 
this is very much work in progress, and really just a learning experience with understanding bash scripting. 
Learning a lot about it as this is my first script and I am hundreds of lines in with many difffernt problem solving checks and variables and functions, etc.
